# ActivityFinder
Repository for CS 360 web application project

Idea:

Users populate, rate, and comment on Activities (like Yelp for dates or FHE)

Motivation:

Coming up with an idea for a date, or a weekend family outing can be hard. Often what you care about is more about making a memory than where the food tastes the best. Sites like yelp or google reviews can only get you so far. What people really want is a shortcut to finding the right activity for their situation.

App:

The idea we came up with is to develop a site where users can post an activity, and others can rate and comment on that activity. Functionality may include location tagging, price, category tags, ideal person count, store tagging/info searching and filtering by these fields, mobile friendly design.
